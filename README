= Sifolux =

Sifolux is a program that allows you to download streams and schedule the downloads easily.
If a stream stops for some reason, 
the download will continue when the stream is available again


Downloading
----------
The prebuilt version can be found here:
http://cloud.github.com/downloads/meyogi/sifolux/sifolux_0_0_1.tar.gz


Required packages
-----------------
For using the prebuilt version, the following packages need to be installed:
libmms0
libgtkada-2.8

For building from the source:
gnat-4.3
libmms-dev
libgtkada2-dev


Building from source
--------------------
cd to the directory where the file "sifolux.gpr" is located, and then:
gprmake -Psifolux
this will create a the executable binary called "sifolux" under the "build" directory.


Installing
----------
After installing the required packages listed above, just put the binary file "sifolux" wherever you like.

Usage
-----
Run the application from the command line:
[~]$ /path/to/binary/file/sifolux

The download streams are saved under ~/sifolux_downloads
The exact location is based on the name of the download and the time the download started.
For example, if a download is scheduled to begin at 23/7/2010 and its name is "my_favorite_program", 
then the location of the downloaded files could be something like: 
~/sifolux_downloads/my_favorite_program/20100723_2/

Files that were downloaded from a Live stream are not seekable.
Downloading of a Prerecorded stream (non Live stream) is, currently, unsupported. 
It is possible to download such a stream, but the downloaded file might not be complete.

The only supported protocol right now is MMS.
